I've included a blueprint for the kind of preserves jar George built for me way back in the day.^^With a deluxe preserves jar; you can make jellies from fruits, jams from jellies, and compotes from jams. Just put the jam or jelly back into the machine with more of the same crop to process it further.^^This type of preserves jar will also make jellies from flowers, herbs and spices; and will also pickle wild vegetables, mushrooms and nuts.^^It's much more useful than a standard preserves jar, building a few would help you make a wider variety of products. Let me know how it goes^^- Evelyn",

    "Demetrius.Astral.Tea.MailText": "^Hello @,^^I was doing a bit of research on a favorite fruit of mine, known as a carambola. This fruit is very closely related to the starfruit, in fact, carambola is also commonly called 'starfruit'.^^The only difference is that carambola grow on trees, and starfruit are a seasonal crop.^^^I discovered during my research that the flavor of this fruit can be infused into tea leaves to make a speacial tea, known as 'Astral Tea'.^^If you collect the extract from carambola zest using a juice keg, you can combine it with a white tea leaf in an oxidation unit. My experiments showed that loading the extract into the machine before the tea leaves produced the best results.^^Theoretically, you should be able to infuse any type of leaf with any type of fruit essence, but there are probably only a handful of viable combinations.^^Here is a sample of one of the leaves I produced. If you discover any other tea flavor combinations, I would be interested to hear about them.^^Sincerely,^Demetrius",
